TERM | DEFINITION
-|-
Adversary Emulation | Emulating/Mimicking an adversary's/APT's TTPs with little or no deviation (using same payloads, tools). This requires intelligence on real adversary to be as accurate as possible
Assumed Breach | The Assumed Breach Model assumes a threat has some level of access to a target at the initiation of the engagement
Blue Teaming | Defensive approach where a team or organization focuses on protecting their systems, networks, and data from potential security threats. Primary objective is to ensure the security and resilience of an organization's infrastructure and assets. They perform it through the variety of activities including: security monitoring, incident response, vulnerability management, threat intelligence
C2 | Command and Control
CTI | Cyber Threat Intelligence - Information collected, aggregated, analyzed and interpreted to provide the context for decision-making processes regarding threats.
Endpoint Security | Practice of securing endpoints or end-user devices like desktops, laptops, servers and mobile devices from being exploited by malicious actors and campaigns
EDR | Endpoint Detection and Response, also known as endpoint threat detection and response (ETDR), is an integrated endpoint security solution that combines real-time continuous monitoring and collection of endpoint data with rules-based automated response and analysis capabilities
Exfiltration | Process of extraction of information/data froma target system through a covert channel
FIM | File Intergrity Monitoring
Full Simulation | Simulates only a threat/adversary's attack flow (chain of events) 
IDS | Intrusion Detection System
Incident Responder | Incident responders are responsible for managing and responding to security incidents. They investigate and triage incidents, coordinate with relevant teams or stakeholders, and take appropriate actions to contain and mitigate the impact of security breaches.
Incident Response | Responsibility of Blue teams. Containing and mitigating the impact of security incidents. They investigate security breaches, analyze attack vectors, and take appropriate actions to recover systems and prevent futher compromise.
Initial Access | In penetration testing (pentesting), initial access refers to the phase where the penetration tester attempts to gain unauthorized access or establish a foothold into the target system or network
IoC | Indicator of Compromise - Artifacts used to identify adversarial activity
IPS | Intrusion Prevention System
Operational Impact | Effect of an objective driven action within a target environment
OPLOG | Operator logs are the records generated by Red Team operators during an engagement. <br>  These logs have specific and required fields that must be captured. Typically it is a spreadsheet with timestamps
OPSEC | Operational Security - What that Blue Team can observe and is used to minimize exposure
Purple Teaming | Collaborative approach in cybersecurity that combines elements of both red teaming and blue teaming. It involves coordination and communication between the offensive-focused red team and the defensive-focused blue team to enhance overall security and improve the organization's ability to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats. During a purple team exercise, the red team conducts simulated attacks and shares their techniques, tools, and findings with the blue team. The blue team actively monitors, detects, and responds to these attacks, applying their defensive measures and analyzing the effectiveness of their controls
Security Analyst | Responsible for monitoring and analyzing security events, identifying potential threats or vulnerabilities, and investigating security incidents. They analyze logs, alerts and other security data to detect and respond to potential threats in real-time.
Security Engineer | Security engineers are responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining security solutions and infrastructure. They work on developing secure configurations, deploying and managing security tools, conducting security assessments, and ensuring that security controls are effectively integrated into systems and networks.
Security Monitoring | Monitoring network traffic, system logs, and other security-related events to detect and respond to potential threats in real time. They use security information and event management (SIEM) tools and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to identify suspicios activities and investigate potential security incidents
Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst | SOC analysts are part of a security operations center and play a crucial role in monitoring and responding to security events. They actively monitor network traffic, system logs, and other security data, and analyze them to detect and respond to potential threats. SOC analysts often work with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools and other security technologies.
SIEM | Security Information and Event Management
Situational Awareness | Phase of a Red Team operation used to gather information on targets and the target environment. This information used to determine the next action
Table-top Exercise | An over the table simulation where scenarios are discussed between the red and blue teams to evaluate how they would theoretically respond to certain threats.
Tradecraft | Techniques and procedures during an attack campaign
Threat Intelligence | Gathering and analyzing threat intelligence from various sources, such as security vendors, open-source intelligence, and information sharing communities. This helps blue teams to understand the current threat landscape, anticipate potential attacks, and proactively enhance their defenses.
Threat Intelligence Analyst | Threat intelligence analysts gather and analyze information about potential threats, such as emerging attack techniques, malware, or threat actors. They monitor threat intelligence feeds, conduct research, and provide insights and recommendations to enhance the organization's defenses.
TTPs | Tactics, Techniques & Procedures
Vulnerability Management | Regular assessment of the security posture of systems and networks by conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. They identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, implement patches and updates, and ensure that the infrastructure is adequately protected against known threats.
Vulnerability Management Specialist | Vulnerability management specialists focus on identifying and assessing vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. They conduct vulnerability assessments, coordinate patch management processes, prioritize vulnerabilities, and ensure that systems are adequately protected against known threats.
XDR | Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is a security threat detection and incident response tool that natively integrates multiple security products into a cohesive security operations system that unifies all licensed components. XDR enables an enterprise to go beyond typical detective controls by providing a holistic and yet simpler view of threats across the entire technology landscape. XDR delivers real-time actionable threat information to security operations for better, faster outcomes
