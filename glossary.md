TERM | DEFINITION
-|-
Adversary Emulation | Emulating/Mimicking an adversary's/APT's TTPs with little or no deviation (using same payloads, tools). This requires intelligence on real adversary to be as accurate as possible
Assumed Breach | The Assumed Breach Model assumes a threat has some level of access to a target at the initiation of the engagement
C2 | Command and Control
CTI | Cyber Threat Intelligence - Information collected, aggregated, analyzed and interpreted to provide the context for decision-making processes regarding threats.
Exfiltration | Process of extraction of information/data froma target system through a covert channel
Full Simulation | Simulates only a threat/adversary's attack flow (chain of events) 
IoC | Indicator of Compromise - Artifacts used to identify adversarial activity
Operational Impact | Effect of an objective driven action within a target environment
OPLOG | Operator logs are the records generated by Red Team operators during an engagement.<br>  These logs have specific and required fields that must be captured
OPSEC | Operational Security - What that Blue Team can observe and is used to minimize exposure
Situational Awareness | Phase of a Red Team operation used to gather information on targets and the target environment. This information used to determine the next action
Table-top Exercise | An over the table simulation where scenarios are discussed between the red and blue teams to evaluate how they would theoretically respond to certain threats.
Tradecraft | Techniques and procedures during an attack campaign
TTPs | Tactics, Techniques & Procedures
